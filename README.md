# Blog App: A simple and elegant blog app built with Streamlit and Python

Blog App is a web application that allows you to create, view, search, and manage blog posts using Streamlit and Python. Blog App uses SQLite as the database to store the posts and their details. Blog App also provides some statistics and visualizations of the posts and authors.

## Installation

To run Blog App, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install Streamlit and its dependencies using the following command:

pip install streamlit

You can also use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies. For more details, you can refer to the web search results I found for you .

## Usage

To run Blog App, you need to use the streamlit run command in your command prompt or Anaconda shell. For example, if your file name is blog_app.py, you can type:

streamlit run blog_app.py

This will start a local Streamlit server and open your app in a new tab in your default web browser. You can also pass arguments to your file or use a URL instead of a file name. For more details, you can refer to the web search results I found for you .
